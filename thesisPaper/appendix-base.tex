\chapter{J \texttt{\#:} (Base) Primitive}
\label{base}

The J primitive \texttt{\#:} is a function that allows 
programmers to easily convert numeric values into different number bases. 
For its one argument (\textit{monadic}) usage, 
the primitive defaults to converting values into base 2. 
The result of applying this function as a monad 
is a vector of 0s and 1s, with the indicies giving the appropriate place value
