\chapter{Introduction}
Many scientific and business computing applications work on large data sets naturally structured in regular, multidimensional collections.
In many languages, these multidimensional collections are implemted as nested collections; e.g. a 2-dimensional array of integers would be implemented as an array of arrays of integers.
However, irregular multidimensional collections are also usually implemented as nested collections, with each of the sub-arrays containing a different number of elements.
Thus, when implemented as such, it can be difficult to distinguish regular from irregular multidimensional collections, especially statically, which may lead to a run-time error and program crash.

In most imperative languages with regular multidimensional collections, operations on elements or sub-collections are done within nested looping structures, typically a \it{for loop}.

%For example, a profits report over \it{n} years of 4 quarters of 3 months could be represented as a 3-dimensional array with extents \it{n 4 3};\begin{comment}TODO cite rank\end{comment} cellular automata like Conway's "Game of Life"\begin{comment}TODO cite Conway\end{comment} might be represented on an \it{n} by \it{m} grid - a 2-dimensional array with extents \it{n m}.
%In C, the profits report might be declared with \begin{verbatim}int report[n][4][3]\end{verbatim}; in Scala,
