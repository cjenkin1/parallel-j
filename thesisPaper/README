---- Other comments and information ----

main.tex is, somewhat obviously, the "main" file.  Look for comments
"FIX THIS" in all files to find places where you would put your
own stuff.

The signatures page might still need a bit of work (the prose about
license stuff at the bottom should be checked against the current
requirements, and might need better formatting).
